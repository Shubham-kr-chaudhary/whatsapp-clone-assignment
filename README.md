# WhatsApp Clone

**Live (deployed) demo:** [https://whatsapp-clone-assignment.vercel.app/](https://whatsapp-clone-assignment.vercel.app/)

---

## Quick overview

This repo contains a minimal WhatsApp-like frontend and a backend used for the assignment. Below are step-by-step instructions to run the app locally (frontend + backend) and to run the backend payload processing script required for the assignment.

> Tested with Node.js 16+ and npm 8+. Adjust command prefix (`yarn`) if you prefer Yarn.

## Run the deployed app

Open the live deployment in your browser:

[https://whatsapp-clone-assignment.vercel.app/](https://whatsapp-clone-assignment.vercel.app/)

## Run locally

### 1) Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
* npm (comes with Node)
* Git (optional, if you clone the repo)

### 2) Frontend

1. Open a terminal and change to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd whatsapp-clone-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the frontend to point to the local backend by editing the `.env` (or create it if missing):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/
```

> Make sure there is a trailing slash (`/`) after the port to match how the app composes URLs.

4. Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. The dev server will print the local URL (commonly `http://localhost:5173/`). Open that URL in your browser.

### 3) Backend

1. Open a second terminal and change to the backend folder:

```bash
cd whatsapp-clone-backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the backend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend typically listens on port `4000` (this is what the frontend expects by `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/`). If your backend uses a different port, update the frontend `.env` accordingly and restart the frontend server.

### 4) Send the assignment payload to the backend

If the assignment requires sending a prepared payload file to the backend, run the provided processing script from the backend folder:

```bash
# from whatsapp-clone-backend
npm run process
```

This command should read the assignment payload file (as defined by the backend's scripts) and submit/process it. Check the backend console output for success/failure messages.

## Notes & troubleshooting

* **CORS / network errors:** If the frontend cannot reach the backend, open the browser devtools console and network tab to inspect failing requests. Ensure the backend is running and `VITE_API_URL` is correct.
* **Wrong port:** If the backend uses another port (not `4000`), change `VITE_API_URL` to `http://localhost:<port>/` and reload the frontend.
* **Environment file not loaded:** Vite reads `.env` files at project root. Ensure you restart the frontend after changing `.env`.
* **`npm run process` does nothing:** Check the `package.json` `scripts` for `process` and read the script (it may expect a specific filename or env var). You can run it with debugging (`DEBUG=* npm run process`) if supported.
